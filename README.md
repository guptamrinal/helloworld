# â€œNomoskar"-just hello from where I belong.
THis is going to be my first post(though this profile exits since a long time).I never got motivated enough to upload my work here.But recent times have inspired me a lot bcoz this repos have really helped me a deal in completing two major projects of my academic career and I want to do the same for others. 
I'll start with a FPGA project which I have completed recently-"Audio Synthesiser using FPGA".
Hope you like it!!!
